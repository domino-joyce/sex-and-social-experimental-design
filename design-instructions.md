# Experimental design - zebra finches

Watch this video to get an idea of the background for this experimental design.


We want to design an experiment to test whether beak colour affects mate choice in a bird species. For the purposes of this assessment, we don't need to actually carry out the experiment, so this gives us a bit of freedom. In the assessment, we want to see that you have thought about your design carefully, and know what data you are going to collect, what it will look like, and how you will analyse it. You are going to simulate the data in R, and submit the code to both simulate the data of the type you expect, and subsequently analyse it. We will run this code when we mark your assessment. This is an example of the type of code you might submit.

In our design, we will have two groups of male birds, one group have been given a diet supplement with extra caroteinoid, and one group have been given a normal diet.

We will then allow 100 female birds a free choice to mate with the males, and we will use DNA paternity testing to quantify the number of offpsring collected for each male. If beak colour is important, we predict that the mean number of offspring will be higher for birds with brighter beaks.
