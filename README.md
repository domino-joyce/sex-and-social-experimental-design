# Experimental design for Sex and Social Behaviour


----
**Learning Outcome - sex and social behaviour**

Show evidence of a broad understanding of sexual and social behaviour, and the inter-relationship between different subjects in the field.
Research, design and plan an investigation into an aspect of sexual or social behaviour in the animal kingdom, writing the plan in line with accepted scientific conventions and with reference to current knowledge.


----
**Learning Outcomes - R**

Produce an R script which will generate and analyse a hypothetical dataset
Consider the distribution of the data you plan to collect
Apply your knowledge by using the code available from previous modules (e.g. Animal Form and Function, Evolutionary Biology, Professional and Research Skills for Biologists).


----
**Learning Outcomes - skills**

Read, consider and apply feedback to your work to maximise your understanding
Demonstrate the ability to collate and explain examples of sexual and social behaviour from the scientific literature, identifying limits in our understanding using critical analysis and synthesis.

---
Working through this practical will give you an idea of the type of experimental design expected for your Sex & Social Behaviour assessment, and also provide a source for some useful R code you may wish to adapt in your own design.
